# OOP-Game-Show-App
FSJS 4

Project Overview

This project was created to demonstrate foundational concepts in Javascript OOP and DOM manipulation with the use of Classes and Methods.  In this project we created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Using JavaScript and OOP, a random selected hidden phrase is displayed and a player tries to guess the phrase by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

  1.	Click "Start Game" button to display a gameboard with a random phrase.
  2.	Click the on-screen keyboard to guess a letter in the phrase.
  3.	If you you choose an incorrect letter, you will lose a heart/life. You have 5 chances to miss until you lose the game.
  4.	After the game is over, click "Start Game" button to play a new game.
